This is a very unofficial fork of the outdated pil_mailform extension for TYPO3.

It contains only compatibility fixes and patches for the following:

- TYPO3 6.2 compatibility
- TYPO3 7.6 compatibility (enable compatibility6 extension)
- sr_freecap support


For TYPO3 7.6 you will need the compatibility6 extension. I am working on a native solution.

BEWARE: This release only contains patches and fixes for TYPO3 comapitiblity. IT HAS NO SECURITY UPDATES/FIXES WHATSOEVER. 
Use with cara and on your own responsibility!
